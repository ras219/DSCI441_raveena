DSCI 441 Project Google Play Store App Ratings Analysis



Data Introduction
The Google Play Store App Ratings dataset provides valuable insights into app ratings, categories, pricing, and user reviews. For this project, I will be modeling the app rating based on features to determine what features driver a higher rating. In addition to insights and modelling work, I will also show the outputs in visuals in a webbased manner as the project instructions state. 




Data Exploration
Dataset Overview: The dataset contains ~18K entries (each entry being a unique app) and has attributes such as app name, category, rating, reviews, price, and sentiment analysis of user reviews. 
Propsed Work: 


Step 1: I will perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for further analysis. 


Step 2: I will conduct extensive EDA to determine any trends such as the correlation between ratings and number of reviews.

Step 3: Gathering insights from EDA. Identify what features from an analysis sense is driving the app ratings. 

Step 4: Prepare data for machine learning (i.e dummy variable creation, outlier detection and treatment, normalization, feature engineering). 


Step 5: Model data and determine strongest model 


Step 6: Compile final findings, conclusions, and recommendations for "end product" used to provide someone who is looking to build an app. Will place these outputs in a webapp format.
